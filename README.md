EONS (Encounter based Opportunistic Network Simulator)

Implemented by Salih Safa BACANLI
for Master's thesis. 

For the paper:
S. S. Bacanli, G. Solmaz and D. Turgut. “Opportunistic Message Broadcasting in Campus Environments.” Accepted to Proceedings of IEEE GLOBECOM'15, December 2015. 

The simulator is command-line based and prints out the result of the simulation in terms of results of some metrics.
It is designed as command line intentionally to help developers to write shell scripts to run the program on the background.

Example shell scripts and source files are inlcluded in the project.
